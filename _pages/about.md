Hi! I am Esin Durmus. I am a Research Scientist at Anthropic Societal Impacts team. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford NLP group working with Tatsunori Hashimoto and Dan Jurafsky. I received my PhD from Cornell University where I was advised by Claire Cardie.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Computational Social Science. I am interested in developing evaluation methods and metrics to study the reliability and social impact of NLP/AI systems.
