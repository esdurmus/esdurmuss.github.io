Hi! I am Esin Durmus. I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"> Anthropic </a> Societal Impacts team. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford NLP group working with  <a href="https://thashim.github.io/">Tatsunori Hashimoto</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/"> Dan Jurafsky</a>. I received my PhD from Cornell University where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Computational Social Science. I am interested in developing evaluation methods and metrics to study the **reliability** and **social impact of NLP/AI systems**.
